Usage
-----
```
$ python sorting_algorithms.py [number of integers to sort]
```
This automatically runs through each of the algorithms listed below, using UNIX time command to time each program

if no number of intgers to sort is supplied, default (500) is used		

Purpose
-------
A quick refresh of 5 basic sorting algorithms in Python + a test of their sorting times. The purpose of this exercise is purely to refresh my mind on Python and algorithm basics.
